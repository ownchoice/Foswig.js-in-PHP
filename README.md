# Foswig.js in PHP

_Foswig.js in PHP_ is, as its name suggests, the PHP version of a JavaScript library that allows you to easily create Markov chains based on arbitrary dictionaries to generate readable pseudo-random words.

## Caveats

- I did this as an exercise to learn PHP.
- Therefore, I can't guarantee that it is production-ready.
- The `start` attribute of the `MarkovChain` class has two `null` at the end of every node, but it doesn't seem to cause any bugs ðŸ¤·
- Not thoroughly tested.
